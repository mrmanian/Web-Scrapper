# Regular-Expressions

I created a program to find the 15 most frequently used words on a set of Wikipedia pages. I listed the words and the number of occurrences. The list was sorted in descending order based on the number of occurrences. I only analyzed the pages for the Wikipedia entries with two capital letters since analyzing every single page would require lots of time and power. 

I made two versions of this project:
--One using python
--One using bash
