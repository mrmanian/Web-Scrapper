# Web-Scrapper

I created a program to find the 15 most frequently used words on a set of Wikipedia pages and the number of occurences. The list was sorted in descending order based on the number of occurrences. I only analyzed the pages for the Wikipedia entries with two capital letters since analyzing every single page would require lots of time and power. 

I made two versions of this project:  
--One using python  
--One using bash  

Do note that because of the different tools I used to convert HTML to text (lynx in bash and BeautifulSoup in python) there might be slight differences in the results generated by each program.
